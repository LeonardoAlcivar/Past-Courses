abstract="L.S. Shapley [1953] showed that there is a unique value defined on the classD of all superadditive cooperative games in characteristic function form (over a finite player setN) which satisfies certain intuitively plausible axioms. Moreover, he raised the question whether an axiomatic foundation could be obtained for a value (not necessarily theShapley value) in the context of the subclassC (respectivelyC{\textasciiacutex}, C{\textacutedbl}) of simple (respectively simple monotonic, simple superadditive) gamesalone. This paper shows that it is possible to do this.",
