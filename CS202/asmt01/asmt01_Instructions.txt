Assignment # 1

----------
Background
----------

The mathematical function

    f(x) = 3x+1, if x is an odd integer
         = x/2,  if x is an even integer

produces a sequence of integers when f(x) is repeatedly applied.

To repeatedly apply the function, start with a number and apply the function to
it, then take the answer and apply the same function to it, and repeat the
process until the stopping rule is invoked.

The STOPPING RULE is:

    Part 1:  IF WE REACH 1, STOP.
    Part 2:  IF WE APPLY THE FUNCTION 1000 TIMES
             WITHOUT REACHING 1, STOP.

Part 2 is necessary to avoid long (perhaps infinite) loops.

EXAMPLE 1:

    Choose 8 as the number and apply the function to it.

        f(8) = 4

    Now, apply the same function to 4.

        f(4) = 2

    Now, apply the same function to 2.

        f(2) = 1

    Observe the stopping rule.

    The full sequence, starting with 8, is:

        8 ---> 4 ---> 2 ---> 1

    This sequence has a starting number of 8.
    This sequence a maximum number of 8.
    This sequence has length 4.

EXAMPLE 2:

    Choose 13 as the number and apply the function to it.

        f(13) = 40

    Now, apply the same function to 40.

        f(40) = 20

    Now, apply the same function to 20.

        f(20) = 10

    Now, apply the same function to 10.

        f(10) = 5

    Now, apply the same function to 5.

        f(5)  = 16

    Now, apply the same function to 16.

        f(16) = 8

    Now, apply the same function to 8.

        f(8)  = 4

    Now, apply the same function to 4.

        f(4) = 2

    Now, apply the same function to 2.

        f(2) = 1

    Observe the stopping rule.

    The full sequence, starting with 13, is:

        13 ---> 40 ---> 20 ---> 10
           --->  5 ---> 16 --->  8
           --->  4 --->  2 --->  1

    This sequence has a starting number of 13.
    This sequence a maximum number of 40.
    This sequence has length 10.

Question
--------

Does the process always reach 1?

Program Requirements
--------------------

The assignment is to write a program to perform the steps outlined above.

The MS Visual Studio project must build without warnings and without errors to
receive credit.

Write a menu-driven program that computes the sequence for range of numbers and
produces two output files.

Here is what the main menu shall look like:

    MAIN MENU

    What would you like to do?

    1.  Compute sequences
    2.  Quit

If selection (1) is chosen, ask questions of the user.

First, ask:

    Enter the starting number:

Then, ask:

    Enter the ending number:

Implement error-checking in the program.

Make sure both numbers entered are positive integers.  If not, exit the program
with an appropriate error message and non-zero exit code.

Make sure the first entered number is less than (not less than or equal to) the
second.  If not, exit the program with an appropriate error message and non-zero
exit code.

With verified (i.e., good) inputs, compute the sequence for every number in the
range, observing the stopping rule.

For example, if the user enters the two numbers 11 and 15, the program will
compute the sequences for 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.

For each sequence, the program needs to keep track of the following
information.

    (a)  the starting number for the sequence
    (b)  the maximum number in the sequence
    (c)  the length of the sequence

In addition, because you will be computing sequences for many numbers, the
program must keep track of

    (d)  beginning of range
    (e)  end of range
    (f)  the starting number for the sequence with minimum length
    (g)  the length for the sequence with minimum length
    (h)  the starting number for the sequence with maximum length
    (i)  the length for the sequence with maximum length

As mentioned above, the program shall contain error-checking on the data
entered.  The program shall not proceed with invalid data.

------
Output
------

As output, the program shall write two files.

The first output file shall contain a table of all the results for the range of
integers for which the sequences were computed:

    (a)  the starting number for the sequence
    (b)  the maximum number in the sequence
    (c)  the length of the sequence

Here is the format for the first ouput file.

    LINE 1:  Starting Number,Maximum Number,Length
    LINE 2:  #,#,#
    LINE 3:  #,#,#
    LINE 4:  #,#,#
    and so on

The second output file shall contain the summary information for the two
sequences that represent the minimum and maximum sequence lengths for the range
of numbers:

    (d)  beginning of range
    (e)  end of range
    (f)  the starting number for the sequence with minimum length
    (g)  the length for the sequence with minimum length
    (h)  the starting number for the sequence with maximum length
    (i)  the length for the sequence with maximum length

It will also contain the complete sequences for both.

Here is the format for the second ouput file.

    Beginning of range:  #

    End of range:  #

    Starting number for the sequence with minimum length:  #
    The minimum length:                                    #

    Starting number for the sequence with maximum length:  #
    The maximum length:                                    #

    Sequence with minimum length:  #
                                   #
                                   #
                                   and so on

    Sequence with maximum length:  #
                                   #
                                   #
                                   and so on

As an example, suppose the range was 11 to 13.

This would generate three sequences.

    11:  11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
    12:  12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
    13:  13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

The two output files are included with this write-up for you to view.

-------------------------------
Example Output File:  .csv File
-------------------------------

The first output file, named asmt01.csv, would contain:

    Starting Number,Maximum Number,Length
    11,52,15
    12,16,10
    13,40,10

The output file asmt01.csv can be opened by Microsoft Excel.  Notice that commas
delimit the data in that file.  Notice also there are no spaces before or after
the commas.  Here is a reference.

Name the first output file asmt01.csv.

Name the second output file asmt01.txt.

-------
Turn In
-------

Submit to the drop box a .zip file that contains your MS Visual Studio project.

Before zipping, you may shrink the size of the directory structure by deleting
certain subdirectories.  You may delete the IPCH subdirectory.

If you built in Debug mode, you may delete the Debug subdirectories (you will
find two in the project).

If you built in Release mode, you may delete the Release subdirectories (you
will find two in the project).

The MS Visual Studio project must build without warnings and without errors to
receive credit.
