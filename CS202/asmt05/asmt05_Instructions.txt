ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT

This additional requirement was suggested by someone in class.

Read Chapter 12, specifically Sections 12.7 and 12.8.

Incorporate the ideas of those sections into your program to accomplish the
following additional program requirement.

Add two menu items to your menu.

    (1)  to allow the user to write the contents of the array
         of structs to an output file

    (2)  the other to allow the user to read the contents of
         the output file into an array of structs

By adding these two menu choices, you extend the program by giving it the
flexibility to:

    ---  save it's current data set, and
    ---  restore the data set from an earlier session

When incorporating the two menu items into the program, please play particular
attention to the NOTE at the bottom of page 679.

Here is a design question.

How shall the user specify, to the program, the name of the output file (which
will later become an input file).

First, the file name should not end in .txt, because it will be a binary file.

Second, should the user

    ---  pass the information on the command line?

or

    ---  specify the file's name in a prompt/answer dialog?

Since you are the program designer, it's your choice.

Note that using a command line approach requires the program's designer to
design a command line syntax and supply a help screen to insure the user knows
how to use the program correctly.
