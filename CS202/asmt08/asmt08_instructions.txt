SUMMARY
-------

Abstract Base Classes:

   This problem requires you to write an abstract base class
   and inherit from it several times.

   An abstract base class is characterized by the fact that
   it has at least one pure virtual function.

   No instance of an abstract base class is allowed, therefore
   only derived classes can be instantiated.

Write C++ classes and driver program(s) to solve the problem listed below.

Compile, debug and run your classes and driver program(s).

Turn In
-------

Turn in a .ZIP file [to the drop box] that contains your MS Visual Studio
project.

Before zipping, you may shrink the size of the directory structure by deleting
certain subdirectories.  You may delete the IPCH subdirectory.

If you built in Debug mode, you may delete the Debug subdirectories (you will
find two in the project).

If you built in Release mode, you may delete the Release subdirectories (you
will find two in the project).

9. File Filter

A file filter reads an input file, transforms it in some way, and writes the results to an output file. Write an abstract file filter class that defines a pure 
virtual function for transforming a character. Create one derived class of your 
file filter class that performs encryption, another that transforms a file to 
all uppercase, and another that creates an unchanged copy of the original file. 

The class should have the following member function:

void doFilter(ifstream &in, ofstream &out)

This function should be called to perform the actual filtering. The member function for transforming a single character should have the prototype:

char transform(char ch)

The encryption class should have a constructor that takes an integer as an 
argument and uses it as the encryption key.
