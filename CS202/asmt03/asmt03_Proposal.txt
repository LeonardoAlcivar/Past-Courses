Assignment Expansion Proposal

asmt03, as a "rudimentary text processor," might be expanded in the following ways:

1. Implementing menu functionality, allowing a user to perform
   selected functions, be it through a displayed menu, or 
   through cmd line arguments
   - Ex: User could choose to count something, replace something,
         etc.

2. Add other useful counts, such as a word count

3. For more file I/O practice, different replacement, insertion,
   deletion, appending, or prepending functionality
   - Ex: Insert a word or character before or after a target
         word or character 
   - Ex: replace entire words/character sequences, as opposed
         to single characters if desired
