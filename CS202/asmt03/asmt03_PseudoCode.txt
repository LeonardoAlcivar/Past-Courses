Psuedo-code outline

1. Check and process command line arguments
     - Check both number and format of arguments
     - Store values in a way that is meaningful to the
       program  
     - Display help or exit program as necessary

2. Check file dimensions, notify user through help screen
   and exit if dimensions are invalid
     - Open file
     - No line may contain more than 256 characters
     - File must be less than 1000 lines long
     - Close file
     - Save the file length for later dynamic memory
       allocation and file reading parameters

3. Get original counts of ASCII characters
     - Open text/IO file
     - Read through file, tracking counts in a dynamically
       allocated array
     - Close text/IO file
     - Create original summary file
         - Open summary file
         - Output counts of interest
         - Close summary file

4. Perform character replacement
     - Open text/IO file in I/O mode
     - Iterate through the file storing the contents of 
       the file to dynamically allocated memory buffers
     - While reading in characters, make replacements as
       necessary
     - Track character counts, again with a dynamically
       allocated array (not the same one as in step 3)
     - Now that text/IO file has been completely read,
       switch to output mode and append the new file
       contents (with replacements) to the text/IO file
     - Close the text/IO file
     - Append new summary to the old one
         - Open summary file in append mode
         - Append counts of interest
         - Close summary file
