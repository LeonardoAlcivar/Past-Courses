* THE CODE *
************
I did this assignment on my personal laptop which has a Windows operating
system and a weak GPU. Also this means my code was written using Visual Studio.
All of these factors mean several things:
  1) I do not have a Makefile. I am more than happy to provide one if
  necessary, and I have tried to make my code as portable as possible. Please 
  me know if I need to take any action in this regard.

  2) My results may be quite different from other student's work, but I have
  done my best to reason about and explain any surprises. Please let me know
  if anything I have done is insufficient and should be changed.

Also, the assignment document said to write two programs, one sequential and
one parallel. I found it easier for data collection to just write functions
and contain them in the same program. If need be, I would be happy to separate
the two if necessary.

**************
* THE REPORT *
**************
I made many charts for my report, but without specification, I was unsure what
was desired and what was not. So I made charts/graphs until I was sick of it,
and then I stopped. As with everything else, please let me know if anything
should be remedied.


Please let me know if there are any issues whatsoever so that I can remedy them
as quickly as possible.
